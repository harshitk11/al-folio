**Research Areas :** Computer Security, Secure Hardware

I am a third year Ph.D. student working in [GREEN](https://greenlab.ece.gatech.edu/) lab under the guidance of [Prof. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://greenlab.ece.gatech.edu/members/professor/). My research interests are focused on developing systematic approaches for hardening different layers of the compute stack against malicious agents. 

Following this approach, I have developed techniques for evaluating the trustworthiness of current Hardware-based Malware Detectors by [quantifying the uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11519) in its decisions. I have also worked on developing Hardware-based Malware Detectors that utilize signatures derived from the [power management infrastructure](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9186163), as well as [Electromagnetic Emissions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9432941) in modern SoCs. My current work focuses on creating practical hardware-based malware detectors that offer a degree of explainablity to its decisions, rather than the black-box machine learning based detectors that are ubiquitous in academic literature. 

My undergraduate thesis, at IIT Kharagpur, focused on  [functional encryption techniques](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946748) to secure the Intellectual Property (IP) against adversaries in the Intergrated Circuit design supply chain. As part of my senior year internship under [Prof. Ramesh Karri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ramesh-karri) at New York University, I worked on camouflaging techniques for [securing the IP of RSFQ circuits](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8663415), a class of superconducting circuits employed in Quantum Computers. Apart from these projects, I have worked on different projects in the domain of signal processing during my undergraduate studies. I am a Formula-1 enthusiast, love playing badminton, and reading non-fiction in my spare time.
