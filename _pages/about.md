**Research Areas :** Computer Security, Secure Hardware

I am a second year Ph.D. student working in [GREEN](https://greenlab.ece.gatech.edu/) lab under the guidance of [Prof. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://greenlab.ece.gatech.edu/members/professor/). My research interests are focused on developing systematic approaches for hardening different layers of the compute stack against malicious agents. 

Following this approach, I have developed a power-management based kernel level [exploit](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3370748.3406549) that undermines the resource allocation fairness in modern commercial System-on-Chips (SoCs). I have also worked on developing hardware-based malware detectors that utilize signatures derived from the [power management infrastructure](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9186163), as well as Electromagnetic Emissions in modern SoCs (under review at IEEE TIFS). My current work focuses on creating practical hardware-based malware detectors that offer a degree of explainablity to its decisions, rather than the black-box machine learning based detectors that are ubiquitous in academic literature. For this purpose, I have designed Bayesian inspired machine learning techniques to evaluate the trustworthiness of Hardware-based malware detectors (submitted at DAC 2021).

My undergraduate thesis, at IIT Kharagpur, focused on  [functional encryption techniques](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946748) to secure the Intellectual Property (IP) against adversaries in the Intergrated Circuit design supply chain. As part of my senior year internship under [Prof. Ramesh Karri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ramesh-karri) at New York University, I worked on camouflaging techniques for [securing the IP of RSFQ circuits](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8663415), a class of superconducting circuits employed in Quantum Computers. Apart from these projects, I have worked on different projects in the domain of signal processing during my undergraduate studies.
