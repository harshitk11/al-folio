In this work, we propose an ensemble-based framework for estimating the predictive uncertainties in Hardware-based Malware Detectors (HMDs). The predictive uncertainty is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of the decisions made by the HMDs. We demonstrate, using empirical results, both data uncertainty and model uncertainty encountered during the task of classifying a workload into benign or malicious.

We consider the following scenarios that an HMD might encounter post-deployment: (1) What happens if the HMD encounters a signature generated by a zero-day malware that wasn't part of its training data? (2) What happens if the HMD encounters a signature that lies in the region of overlap between malicious and benign workload? Our proposed framework helps evaluate these critical scenarios, increasing the trustworthiness of the decisions made by the HMDs.
